This README provides step-by-step instructions on how to clone the project, navigate to the right directories to see the relevant scripts, and access the directory that contains the desired simulation scenes.

Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have git installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from here.

Cloning the Repository
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you want the project to be cloned.

Viewing Scripts
Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the scripts directory:
bash
Copy code
```cd HEALTHVR/Assets/Scripts/Microbiology```
Here, you will find all the scripts related to the project. Use your preferred code editor or cat (on Unix systems) or type (on Windows) to view the content of each script.
Accessing the Simulation Scenes
From the root of the cloned directory, navigate to the simulations scene directory:
bash
Copy code
```cd HEALTHVR/Assets/Scenes/A1_Courses```
Here, you will find all the simulation scenes. Depending on the type of simulation files, use the appropriate software to open and run them.
